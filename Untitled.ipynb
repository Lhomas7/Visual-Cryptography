    "Have you ever wanted to show a picture to someone, but only allow for the two of you to see it? One way to do so is through a visual cryptograhy scheme (VCS), which will divide an original image $\\text{IC}$ into two shares, allocated to two participants. Both participants must meet in order to decode $\\text{IC}$. In this particular example, we are discussing a 2 out of 2 VCS, where 2 total shares are given to 2 parties and both parties must meet in order to decode the original image. We will discuss a standard modeling for a (2,2) VCS, then demonstrate a way to represent the scheme in python code."

    "In the (2,2) VCS, we will define our set of participants as $\\mathcal{P}$, s.t. $\\mathcal{P}$ = {1, 2}. $2^\\mathcal{P}$ denotes all subsets of $\\mathcal{P}$, refered to as the powerset of $\\mathcal{P}$. Next we define $\\Gamma_{qual} \\subseteq 2^\\mathcal{P}$ where $\\Gamma_{qual}$ contains all sets of combined participants that must meet in order to recover the original image. $\\Gamma_{qual}$ is called the set of \"qualified families.\" The counterpart to $\\Gamma_{qual}$ is $\\Gamma_{forb} \\subseteq 2^\\mathcal{P}$, the set of \"forbidden families\" of $\\mathcal{P}$ that cannot recover the original image, and $\\Gamma_{qual} \\cap \\Gamma_{forb} = \\emptyset$, and $\\Gamma_{qual} \\cup \\Gamma_{forb} = 2^\\mathcal{P}$. For the sake of our specific scheme: $$\\Gamma_{qual} = \\{\\{1, 2\\}\\}$$ and  $$\\Gamma_{forb} = \\{\\{1\\},\\{2\\}\\}$$ The pair ($\\Gamma_{qual}, \\Gamma_{forb}$) is reffered to as the access structure of the scheme. This means that $\\forall X \\in \\Gamma_{qual}$, $\\text{IC}$ can be recovered, and $\\forall X \\in \\Gamma_{forb}$, $\\text{IC}$ cannot be recovered. each $ p \\in \\mathcal{P}$, will receive a share of each pixel of the orignal image assigned uniformly at random. In the case of the (2,2) VCS, particpants 1 and 2 are uniformly at random allocated an encoded pixel for all of the original pixels in the original image. Each pixel is represented by 4  black and white subpixels, which can be further represented by a binary matrix $M$, where a 1 represents a black subpixel and a 0 represents a white subpixel. In our scheme, each pixel's orientation will be either a \"black\" orientation $b$ or a \"white\" orientation $w$, while schemes with a larger amount of particpants may contain more orientations. We also want the relative difference $\\alpha$ and the contrast $\\alpha \\cdot 4$ to be as large as possible, constituting a VCS that can be visually recognized with minimal \"fuzziness.\" In this case with two orientations of pixels, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\alpha \\cdot m = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 4 = 1$. The relative difference, and therefore the contrast, can be calculated easily be comparing the number of black or white pixels to a pixel of a given share. Finally, to model each pixel so that we can recover the original image through overlaying, the orientations are done in a special way. A $b$ pixel's matrix representation is: $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &0\\\\ 0 &1 \\end{pmatrix}$$ and a $w$ pixel's matrix representation is: $$\\begin{pmatrix} 0 &1\\\\ 1 &0 \\end{pmatrix}$$ The participant matrix $M$ is a $|\\mathcal{P}|$ x 4 matrix representing each participant's randomly assigned pixel for all pixels in the image. Each row $i$ is a row condensed form of the $b$ or $w$ binary matrix. For example, if particpant 1 received a $b$ pixel and participant 2 received a $w$ pixel, the $M$ matrix would be: $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &0 &0 &1 \\\\ 0 &1 &1 &0 \\end{pmatrix}$$ Utilizing the shares of both participants, we can decrypt the original image through overlaying the shares of participants in qualifying sets.\n",

    "When the two particpants meet, the decoding of the original image is done by the human visual system by overlaying the shares. However to represent this mathematically, we will use a form of matrix addition. The summation of two matrices is s.t. if the binary matrices are equivalent: $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &0\\\\ 0 &1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &0\\\\ 0 &1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &0\\\\ 0 &1 \\end{pmatrix}$$ $$\\begin{pmatrix} 0 &1\\\\ 1 &0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &1\\\\ 1 &0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &1\\\\ 1 &0 \\end{pmatrix}$$ and when the matrixces are different: $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &0\\\\ 0 &1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &1\\\\ 1 &0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &1\\\\ 1 &1 \\end{pmatrix}$$ The resulting matrices contain all 1's or 1's and zeros, creating a contrast between two pixels two enable for seeing a black pixel or a white pixel that has a slightly grey color. Given knowledge on one of the shares and orientations, we are unable to decode the original pixel. To prove this, we will analyze the security of the scheme."

    "Now that we have demonstrated how to decode our image, we must next prove that it is secure. Consider a (2,2) VCS scheme with particpants $p_1$ and $p_2$ and an original image OI that is currently unknown. Let $S$ be a random variable of the set $\\{b, w\\}$. Then $p_1$'s first pixel $a$ and $p_2$'s first pixel $c$ are each either $b$ oriented or $w$ oriented such that $P_r[S = a] = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P_r[S = c] = \\frac{1}{2}$. We want to show that for either pixel, $P_r[S = a | S = c]$ = $\\frac{1}{2}$. First, let us consider $P_r[a = b]$. We can expand this using Baye's Theorem: $$P_r[a = b] = P_r[a = b|c = b] \\cdot P_r[c = b] + P_r[a = b|c = w] \\cdot P_r[c = w]$$ Since $P_r[S = a] = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P_r[S = c] = \\frac{1}{2}$, we can rewrite the equation as $$P_r[a = b] = P_r[a = b|c = b] \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}  + P_r[a = b|c = w] \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$$  $$= \\frac{1}{2}(P_r[a = b|c = b] + P_r[a = b|c = w])$$ $$= \\frac{1}{2} (1)$$ $$= \\frac{1}{2}$$ As shown, the probability of $p_1$'s first pixel being $b$ oriented does not change when the orientation of $p_2$'s first pixel is known. This process can be repeated for the remaining values of $a$ and $c$ to encompass the entire scheme, where each will equal $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, our scheme is both secure and decodable."
